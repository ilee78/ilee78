  - ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Isabelle. I'm a third-year undergrad at Stanford University studying computer science.

  - ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all things audio, particularly AI/ML in audio, immersive spatial audio, audio plugin creation for DAWs, music production, gaming audio, and audiovisual rehabilition therapy. I'm also interested in investigating algorithmic bias in race, ethnicity, and gender, and methods to proactively combat them.

  - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about convolutional neural networks for computer vision, audio plugin development, and algorithmic biases in medicine.
